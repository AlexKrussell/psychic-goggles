                    <h2>Meet the Creator!</h2>
                    <p>A13XplaysMC (better known as Alex) is a Minecraft YouTuber. They create mostly "Let's Play" content with some tutorials mixed in. After watching a few videos you will see that Alex really likes to include timelapses. Sometimes those timelapses are set to the beat of a song. One thing you will see for sure is this skilled builder is a fan of up beat music. Check out some images of past builds in the "Gallery" and make sure to subcribe to their YouTube channel. You can find a link to their YouTube on the "Contacts" page.</p>
